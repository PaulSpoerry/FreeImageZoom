FreeImageZoom 
==============

Fork of hoverfree which is a fork of hoverzoom.net -- this Chrome extension will show an image if you hover its thumbnail or a link.

Read why here: http://goo.gl/g1Qi1k or see http://goo.gl/apOKxa for discussion.

HoverFree is now deprecated and the developer highly recommends you try out http://my.opera.com/Deathamns/blog/opera-extension-imagus as he's decided to discontinue support for HoverFree.


Philosophy:
===========
FreeImageZoom is for my own use and development. You are welcome to contribute but this is an unsupported application. FreeImageZoom will however follow HoverFree's philosophy:

FreeImageZoom will be free to use and help people preview a linked image.

FreeImageZoom will never inject advertising, referral links, adware, spyware, etc.

FreeImageZoom will never track or record browsing activity.

Installation:
=============

Easiest method is Chrome Web Store: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/<store link here>

For manual installation, simplest method is:
```
git archive --format zip --output ~/FreeImageZoom.zip master 
```
