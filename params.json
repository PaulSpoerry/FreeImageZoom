{"name":"FreeImageZoom","tagline":"Show an image if you hover its thumbnail or a link.","body":"FreeImageZoom \r\n==============\r\n\r\nFork of hoverfree which is a fork of hoverzoom.net -- this Chrome extension will show an image if you hover its thumbnail or a link.\r\n\r\nHoverFree is now deprecated and the developer highly recommends you try out http://my.opera.com/Deathamns/blog/opera-extension-imagus as he's decided to discontinue support for HoverFree. Read why here: http://goo.gl/g1Qi1k or see http://goo.gl/apOKxa for discussion.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilosophy:\r\n===========\r\nFreeImageZoom is for my own use and development. You are welcome to contribute but this is an unsupported application. FreeImageZoom will however follow HoverFree's philosophy:\r\n\r\nFreeImageZoom will be free to use and help people preview a linked image.\r\n\r\nFreeImageZoom will never inject advertising, referral links, adware, spyware, etc.\r\n\r\nFreeImageZoom will never track or record browsing activity.\r\n\r\nInstallation:\r\n=============\r\n\r\nEasiest method is Chrome Web Store: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/<store link here>\r\n\r\nFor manual installation, simplest method is:\r\n```\r\ngit archive --format zip --output ~/FreeImageZoom.zip master \r\n```\r\n","google":"UA-1151798-8","note":"Don't delete this file!
